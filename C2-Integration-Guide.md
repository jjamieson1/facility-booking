# Authenticating to C2 (TrustIdentity) — agent integration guide

**Audience:** an AI coding agent (or developer) implementing or fixing authentication
in a **downstream client application** that uses C2 (TrustIdentity) as its identity
provider. Follow these rules literally; they encode mistakes that have already cost
real debugging time.

C2 is a standard **OpenID Connect** provider. There is nothing exotic here — but
three things trip people up every time: using the wrong origin, forcing
re-authentication by accident, and hardcoding URLs instead of discovering them.

---

## 0. Golden rules (do these or nothing works)

1. **One origin.** Talk to C2 _only_ through its **portal origin** — the single public
   host that serves the citizen portal and fronts C2's API. **Never** target C2's
   internal API host/port directly. The portal origin is also the token `iss` you must
   verify. (Dev: `http://localhost:5173`. The API on `:8088` is internal — do not use it.)
2. **Discover, don't hardcode.** Read every endpoint (authorize, token, JWKS, …) from
   `GET <issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Paths change; discovery is the contract.
3. **Authorization Code + PKCE (S256).** Public clients (SPA/mobile) MUST use PKCE.
   Confidential clients (server-side) use PKCE _and_ the client secret.
4. **Do NOT force re-authentication unless you mean it.** Do **not** send
   `prompt=login` and do **not** send `max_age=0`. Either one makes C2 re-prompt the
   user for credentials on every visit even when they already have an active C2 session —
   defeating SSO. (This is the #1 "why am I asked to log in again?" cause.)
5. **Verify every token.** Validate signature (JWKS from discovery), `iss`, `aud`, `exp`,
   and `nonce`. Trust `sub` only after all checks pass.

---

## 1. What you need from the C2 administrator

Ask the C2 admin to register your application and give you:

| Item                             | Notes                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Portal origin**                | e.g. `https://portal.example.gov/c2` (dev: `http://localhost:5173`). Everything derives from here.    |
| **`client_id`**                  | Your OAuth client id. It is the `aud` you must expect in id_tokens and in inbound callout assertions. |
| **`client_secret`**              | Confidential (server-side) clients only. Never ship it to a browser.                                  |
| **Registered `redirect_uri`(s)** | Exact-match. C2 rejects any redirect_uri not pre-registered.                                          |
| **Scopes**                       | Which of `openid profile email phone address offline_access` your app may request.                    |

**Do not** invent a `client_id`, reuse another app's, or point at a client that belongs to
a different application — C2 signs tokens with `aud` = _your_ client, and it must match
what you verify. A mismatched `aud` is a silent `401`/`invalid token`.

---

## 2. Discover the endpoints

```
GET <portal-origin>/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Cache the result. Use these fields:

- `issuer` — the exact string you must see in every token's `iss`.
- `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `userinfo_endpoint`, `end_session_endpoint`.
- `jwks_uri` — fetch the signing keys here; cache them and refresh on an unknown `kid`.

> DO NOT hardcode `jwks_uri` or any endpoint path. Read them from discovery every deploy.

---

## 3. Part A — Log a user in (Authorization Code + PKCE)

### 3.1 Build the authorization request

```
GET <authorization_endpoint>
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=<your client_id>
  &redirect_uri=<one of your registered redirect_uris>
  &scope=openid%20profile%20email          # openid is required; add only what you need
  &state=<random, unguessable>             # CSRF binding — verify on return
  &nonce=<random, unguessable>             # replay binding — must equal id_token.nonce
  &code_challenge=<BASE64URL(SHA256(verifier))>
  &code_challenge_method=S256
```

Rules:

- **DO** generate a fresh `code_verifier` (43–128 chars), store it in the user's session,
  and derive `code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(verifier))`.
- **DO** generate fresh `state` and `nonce` per request and store them for verification.
- **DO NOT** add `prompt=login`. Omit `prompt` entirely for normal SSO. (Use `prompt=none`
  only for a _silent_ check — see §3.5.)
- **DO NOT** add `max_age=0` (or any tiny `max_age`) unless you deliberately want to force
  re-auth. Omit it, or set a sane value like `max_age=3600`.

### 3.2 Handle the redirect back

C2 redirects to your `redirect_uri` with `?code=…&state=…`.

- **Verify `state`** equals what you stored. Reject otherwise.
- If you get `?error=…` instead, handle it (see §3.5 for `prompt=none` errors).

### 3.3 Exchange the code for tokens

```
POST <token_endpoint>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=<code from the redirect>
&redirect_uri=<same redirect_uri as in the auth request>
&client_id=<your client_id>
&code_verifier=<the verifier you stored>
# Confidential clients also authenticate the client, e.g.:
# Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)
```

Response: `{ access_token, id_token, refresh_token?, token_type: "Bearer", expires_in }`.

### 3.4 Validate the `id_token` (do ALL of these)

1. Verify the RS256 signature with the JWK whose `kid` matches the token header, fetched
   from `jwks_uri`.
2. `iss` **exactly equals** the discovery `issuer`.
3. `aud` **equals your `client_id`**.
4. `exp` is in the future; `iat` is sane.
5. `nonce` **equals** the `nonce` you sent.

Only then map `sub` to your user record. `sub` is an **opaque, stable** identifier — not an
email or name. **This is the same `sub` you'll receive in callout assertions** (Part C), so
store it as your link to the C2 identity.

### 3.5 SSO behavior — what to expect

There is no `prompt` value that _means_ "SSO" — SSO is the behavior when `prompt` is
**absent**. Quick reference:

| `prompt`    | Behavior                                                               | Use for                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| _(omitted)_ | **Silent SSO if a session exists; login form if not**                  | ✅ your normal "Log in"              |
| `none`      | Never shows UI — completes silently, or returns `error=login_required` | background "still signed in?" checks |
| `login`     | Forces a fresh login every time (breaks SSO)                           | step-up before a sensitive action    |
| `consent`   | Forces the consent screen                                              | re-confirming consent                |

`max_age=0` forces re-auth regardless of `prompt` — omit it too (or set a real TTL).

- With no `prompt`/`max_age`: if the user already has an active C2 session, C2 **silently
  re-asserts** and redirects straight back with a `code` — no login form. That is the SSO
  you want. If they have no session, C2 shows its login form, then returns.
- `prompt=none`: C2 **never** shows UI. If there's a usable session it completes silently;
  otherwise it redirects back with `?error=login_required` (or `consent_required` /
  `interaction_required`). Use this for background "is the user still signed in?" checks —
  handle the error by doing a normal (promptless) redirect.
- `prompt=login` / `max_age=0`: C2 **forces** a fresh login. Only use these when you have a
  specific reason (e.g. step-up before a sensitive action).

---

## 4. Part B — Call C2 APIs with the access token

Call C2's API through the **same portal origin**, under `/api`:

```
GET <portal-origin>/api/<resource>
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept: application/json
```

- The access token is opaque to you — do not try to parse it for claims; use the
  `id_token`/`userinfo` for identity.
- Need fresh user claims? Call `GET <userinfo_endpoint>` with the bearer access token.
- On `401`, the token is expired/invalid → refresh (§5) or re-run the login flow.
- **DO NOT** call the internal API host/port directly; go through the portal origin.

---

## 5. Refresh tokens (optional)

Request `offline_access` scope to receive a `refresh_token`. Refresh with:

```
POST <token_endpoint>
grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=<the refresh token>
&client_id=<your client_id>
# + client auth for confidential clients
```

Store refresh tokens server-side only, encrypted. Never expose them to a browser.

---

## 6. Logout — both directions

Logout has two independent directions. Handle **both** — otherwise a user who signs out in
one place stays signed in in the other.

### 6.1 RP-initiated logout (your app → C2)

When the user logs out of _your_ app, end your local session and then **redirect the browser**
to the `end_session_endpoint` from discovery with `id_token_hint` (the `id_token` from login),
`client_id`, and a `post_logout_redirect_uri` that is **registered** on your client (C2 400s
otherwise). Clearing only your local session leaves the C2 session active, so the user stays
SSO'd and is silently signed back in by the next authorize request — a logout button that
appears to do nothing.

On a valid request C2 ends the **C2 session** itself (session + CSRF cookies), drops every
relying party's tokens for that user, notifies the other RPs by back-channel logout (§6.2),
and redirects to your `post_logout_redirect_uri`.

**`id_token_hint` is what makes it a logout.** Without a valid hint C2 honours the redirect but
ends nothing — the guard against logout-CSRF (any page could otherwise sign a citizen out of
every federated service). A hint whose subject differs from the C2 session in that browser is
ignored for the same reason. This app therefore stores the raw `id_token` on
`domain.Session` at login purely to present it here. An expired hint is still accepted.

### 6.2 IdP-initiated logout (C2 → your app) — Back-Channel Logout

When the user **explicitly logs out** — either at another relying party (RP-initiated
`end_session`) or by signing out of the **C2 portal** — C2 proactively notifies your app so
you can drop the user's session too. C2 implements **OIDC Back-Channel Logout 1.0**.

> **Scope:** C2 fans out back-channel logout on _explicit_ logout (RP `end_session` **and**
> C2 portal sign-out). It does **not** fire on a passive **session expiry** — an idle C2
> session timing out does not notify RPs. Handle that case with the `prompt=none` fallback
> below (and short local sessions), so you don't leave a user signed in after their C2
> session has simply aged out.

**Setup:** register a `backchannel_logout_uri` (a server endpoint you host) with the C2
administrator. C2 notifies every client the user currently has an active token with that has
one registered — best-effort and detached (a slow endpoint never blocks C2's logout).

**What C2 sends:**

```
POST <your backchannel_logout_uri>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

logout_token=<signed JWT>
```

The `logout_token` is an RS256 JWT (`typ: logout+jwt`, `kid` from the **same JWKS** as
id_tokens):

| claim        | value                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iss`        | the C2 issuer                                                       |
| `aud`        | **your `client_id`**                                                |
| `sub`        | the user (the **same** `sub` as their id_token)                     |
| `events`     | contains `"http://schemas.openid.net/event/backchannel-logout": {}` |
| `iat`, `jti` | issued-at, unique token id                                          |

C2's logout*token is **`sub`-based — there is no `sid`.** It identifies the \_user*, not one
session.

**Your endpoint MUST:**

1. Verify the RS256 signature via `jwks_uri` (match `kid`).
2. Check `iss` == issuer and `aud` == your `client_id`.
3. Check the `events` claim contains the back-channel-logout member above.
4. Confirm a `sub` is present, and **reject the token if it contains a `nonce`** (the spec
   forbids `nonce` in a logout_token).
5. (Optional) dedupe on `jti`; check `iat` is recent.
6. **Terminate ALL local sessions for that `sub`** — you can't target a single one (no `sid`).
7. Respond **`200`** (or **`400`** on a validation failure) with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
   Do not redirect.

**Fallback / defense in depth.** Back-channel delivery is best-effort and only reaches
clients the user still holds an active C2 token with, so don't rely on it alone:

- **Silent re-check:** periodically (or before sensitive actions) run a silent `prompt=none`
  authorization request. `error=login_required` means the C2 session is gone → log the user
  out locally.
- **Short local sessions:** don't let your session long-outlive the C2 session; treat a
  failed token refresh or a `401` from `userinfo` as a logout signal.

C2 does **not** implement front-channel logout or a session-management `check_session_iframe`
(both absent from discovery), so do not build on those.

---

## 7. Part C — Verify C2's inbound callout assertion (reverse direction)

If your app exposes a **Service Card callout** endpoint, C2 calls _you_ server-to-server and
authenticates with a short-lived **RS256 JWT** (bearer). You verify it with the **same
JWKS** you already use for id_tokens.

**Assertion claims:** `iss` = the C2 issuer; `aud` = **your `client_id`**; `sub` = the
citizen (same `sub` as their id_token); `scope` = consented scopes; `exp` ≈ 60s after `iat`;
plus `jti`.

**Verify (all of them):** signature via `jwks_uri`, `iss` == issuer, `aud` == your
`client_id`, `exp` in the future. Only then trust `sub` and map it to your user. Fail closed
(4xx) on any check. Full contract, request/response shape, and an example:
`docs/service-card-callout-integration.md`.

## 8. Gotchas

### Quick symptom → fix

| Symptom                                              | Cause                                                                                                      | Fix                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Re-prompted for login though already signed in       | Client sends `prompt=login` and/or `max_age=0`                                                             | Remove both from the authorize request (§0.4, §3.1)                               |
| `401` / invalid token from C2 (or your callout 401s) | `aud` mismatch — token signed for a different `client_id`, or you're verifying the wrong `client_id`       | Ensure C2 signs with, and you expect, the **same** `client_id`                    |
| Signature/JWKS failure                               | Hardcoded a JWKS path, or pointed at the internal API host                                                 | Discover `jwks_uri`; use the portal origin only                                   |
| `iss` mismatch on verify                             | Configured issuer as the API host/port                                                                     | Issuer is the **portal origin** + `/oidc` — take it from discovery                |
| Intermittent/blank behavior in dev                   | Talking to the internal API host directly, or a stale service worker from another app on the same dev port | Use the portal origin; clear site data if a prior app registered a service worker |

### Subtle behaviors that surprise people

- **`prompt=login` / `max_age=0` are added by default in some client libraries.** Inspect
  the authorize URL your library actually builds — a `maxAge: 0` option that "means unset"
  frequently serializes to `max_age=0` and silently kills SSO. This is the single most
  common "why am I logged in again?" cause.
- **The issuer is the portal origin, even when discovery is served from the API.** Fetching
  `.well-known` from the internal API host still returns `iss` = the _portal_ origin, and
  every token carries that `iss`. Configure your client's issuer as the portal origin, or
  `iss` validation fails even though discovery "worked."
- **Cookies ignore the port; SameSite is per-_site_, not per-origin.** In dev,
  `localhost:5173` and `localhost:8088` are the same site and share the C2 session cookie —
  the port does not isolate it. **But `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` are different cookie
  hosts:** mixing them (issuer on one, your app on the other) drops the session and breaks
  SSO. Pick one hostname and use it everywhere.
- **A first-time or new-scope request bounces to a consent screen — that's expected**, even
  with an active session. It is not a bug. Under `prompt=none` you get
  `error=consent_required` back instead of any UI.
- **Treat both tokens as opaque except `id_token` claims.** Do not parse the access token
  for identity; use `id_token` / `userinfo`. Do not expect an email or name in `sub`.
- **Redirect URIs are exact-match.** A trailing slash, `http` vs `https`, or a port
  difference is a different URI and C2 rejects it. Register every variant you actually use.
- **One canonical OIDC client per application.** C2's server-to-server callout signs with a
  specific client's `client_id` as `aud`. Extra clients registered under the same app (e.g.
  from conformance/test tooling) can shift which `aud` is used and cause `401`s. Register
  test clients under a _separate_ application.
- **A stale service worker from another app on the same dev port will impersonate the
  portal.** If a different PWA once ran on the portal's dev port, its service worker can
  keep serving its cached shell on that origin — you'll see crashes or blank pages that look
  like C2 bugs but aren't. Clear site data (unregister service workers + delete caches) for
  that origin.
- **`token_endpoint` is not `/oidc/token`.** In this deployment it's `/oidc/oauth/token` —
  one more reason to read every endpoint from discovery instead of guessing.
- **Back-channel logout works but is NOT advertised in discovery.** `backchannel_logout_supported`
  is absent from `.well-known`, so you can't feature-detect it — coordinate with the admin,
  register your `backchannel_logout_uri`, and implement §6.2. The `logout_token` is `sub`-based
  (no `sid`), so end _all_ of that user's local sessions. There is no front-channel logout or
  session-management iframe.

## 9. Verification checklist

- [ ] All C2 traffic goes through the **portal origin**; the internal API host/port is never referenced.
- [ ] Endpoints + `jwks_uri` come from `.well-known/openid-configuration`, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Authorization Code flow with **PKCE (S256)**; `state` and `nonce` generated and verified.
- [ ] Authorize request does **not** contain `prompt=login` or `max_age=0`.
- [ ] `id_token` validated: signature, `iss`, `aud`==client_id, `exp`, `nonce`.
- [ ] `sub` stored as the stable link to the C2 identity (opaque; == callout `sub`).
- [ ] API calls use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` against `<portal-origin>/api`.
- [ ] (If applicable) callout endpoint verifies the inbound assertion: sig, `iss`, `aud`==client_id, `exp`.
- [ ] Refresh tokens (if used) are server-side + encrypted; RP-initiated logout uses `end_session_endpoint`.
- [ ] IdP-initiated logout handled: a `backchannel_logout_uri` endpoint validates the logout_token (signature, `iss`, `aud`, `events`, no `nonce`) and ends **all** of that `sub`'s local sessions, returning `200`; optional `prompt=none` fallback for missed notifications.
